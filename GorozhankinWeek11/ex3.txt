First program prints: 
Hello\nHello\n 
because after printf("Hello") fork() produced child process which has the same data. 
=> after printf("\n") new line character is added to the buffer where already the string "Hello". 
As line buffer prints after accepting new line character, child process eventually will print "Hello\n"

Second program prints:
Hello\n\n
because after line printf("Hello\n") in buffer will store "Hello\n" which will be immeadeately printed. 
Then buffer will be flushed, after creation of child process printf("\n") will print only new line
